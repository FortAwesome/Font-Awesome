### Feature request checklist

- [ ] This is a single feature (i.e. not a re-write of all of Font Awesome)
- [ ] The title starts with "Feature request: " and is followed by a clear feature name (Ex: `Feature request: moar cowbell`)
- [ ] I have [searched for existing issues](https://github.com/FortAwesome/Font-Awesome-Pro/issues) and to the best of my knowledge this is not a duplicate
